# AiLearningCanvas
This platform serves to allow users to play with datasets with different models as a way to rekindle that spark to pick up AI whereever they have left off.
Applies to me as I develop this app as a way to catch up on AI and everything that encompasses it (hopefully).

## What this app intends to do
Found a great source that publishes publicly-available datasets (in Reference) to work on the app with. Therefore, this app is planned to operate this way:
1. Allow user to select the datasets
2. User selects what algorithm it wants to use (Deep Learning or Machine Learning)
3. Configure algorithm parameters however users want it
4. Train
5. Test
6. Deploy trained and tested model

## Preface
Went into this head in, in the efforts to learn the 'hard' knowledge of AI. The above is what I ideate to do. While it might subject to change due to new discoveries (what can or cannot be implemented), I hope to stay on course with the app features above.

3. DB - Just structured datasets found in [1] that will be parsed into python
